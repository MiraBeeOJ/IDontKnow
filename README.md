My first repository saved to ReadMe
My first repository OK Here it is..my first repository with content. Today I met my friends for coffee at L's house. I told her about the canvas dog bone I sewed and she asked if I am going to create an Etsy store. I said yes, I am. So that is one project on the way. I also am receiving many comments about my t-shirt bags from perplexed grocery cashiers and baggers. They always comment after realizing it's a bag upcycled from my family's olsd t-shirts. My daughters are mildly embarassed but mostly amused. It is a strong and stretchy fabric.
